<!-- Note MA: Here was an import of vue.js which was not really used. I agree that it would be much better to build this with one framework like vue, angular or react.
But if you decide to import one of those frameworks, then make sure to use it as it should be used. Only using a fraction of the functionality (like in this example)
can lead to various problems in the future. I had no time to rework the whole app with a framework. If you have the time then feel free. Would definitely make sense for this use case. -->
